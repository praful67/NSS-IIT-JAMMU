                                 Keeping hands clean is one of the most important steps we can take to avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others. Many diseases and conditions are spread by not washing hands with soap and clean, running water.Even healthcare providers are at risk of getting an infection while they are treating patients. Preventing the spread of germs is especially important in hospitals and other facilities such as dialysis centers and nursing homes.

There are basically two types of masks to ensure there is no gap between mask and nose.Surgical masks, also called face masks, are usually made of pleated paper or other non-woven material. They’re worn by surgeons to prevent their fluids, such as coughs or sneezes, from contaminating the operating area. They fit loosely and are not designed to filter out the smallest airborne particles.N95 respirators, another type of mask, must be sized to the wearer so they fit snugly around the mouth and nose.N95 respirators are specifically designed for healthcare workers who are in close proximity to infected people. These masks are used to protect workers from exposure to diseases like tuberculosis and measles because they filter out tiny particles that can travel through the air.

                                 Whether you can wash and reuse a face mask depends on what kind of face mask you’re using.If you’re using thin, surgical masks then no, these cannot be washed and reused as they are designed to be disposable, single-use masks.If you’re using a cloth face covering, for example something that you’ve made yourself at home, then yes, you should be washing your face mask between uses.The advice is to put your cloth mask in the wash after every use. So, every time you return home from the supermarket for example, you should put the mask in the wash and let it dry before using it again.

                                 Disposable face masks should be used once and then thrown in the trash. You should also remove and replace masks when they become moist.Always follow product instructions on use and storage of the mask, and procedures for how to put on and remove a mask.  If instructions removing the mask are not available, then follow the steps below:
1.Clean your hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer before touching the mask.Avoid touching the front of the mask. The front of the mask is contaminated. Only touch the ear loops/ties/band.Follow the instructions below for the type of mask you are using.
2.Face Mask with Ear loops: Hold both of the ear loops and gently lift and remove the mask.
3Face Mask with Ties: Untie the bottom bow first then untie the top bow and pull the mask away from you as the ties are loosened.
4.Face Mask with Bands: Lift the bottom strap over your head first then pull the top strap over your head.
