                <p class="margin-bottom-40 margin-top-20 text-size-16 text-dark">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</br>

                  Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</br>
                  
                  The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. </br>
                  
                  The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</br>
                  
                  At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.</br>

                      Pneumonia is a swelling of the lungs that makes it difficult for the body to get enough oxygen. It can be caused by many different bacteria and viruses, including the novel coronavirus.The vaccination which is currently used to protect older people from pneumonia target a type of bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. Unfortunately, this vaccine offers no protection against infection by a coronavirus.It is possible that the vaccination could protect people with coronavirus from getting a Streptococcal pneumonia on top of COVID-19. As yet there is no advice on this from the body that advises UK health departments on immunisation (the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation).

                      Garlic has long been claimed as possessing qualities that aid in the prevention and treatment of various illnesses, including colds and flu, but scientific evidence supporting such claims is weak or lacking.BBC News similarly reported of this rumor that:
                      In lots of cases, these kinds of remedies aren’t harmful in themselves, as long as they aren’t preventing you from following evidence-based medical advice. But they have the potential to be.

                      No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. 
                      There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.

                      The COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather.No study has shown that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C and the most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands using soaps and water. You can also used alcohol-based hand sanitizers.

People of all ages can be infected by coronavirus COVID-19 but older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) are more at risk of becoming severely ill with the virus. The likelihood of having chronic conditions increases markedly as you age. Four in five Australians aged 65 years and over have at least one chronic condition.But the presence of chronic conditions only partially explains the high death rate in older people.As we age, our immune system weakens. This makes us more vulnerable to infections of all types. And any sort of challenge to the body can do more damage.When the immune system gears up in older people, there is also a higher likelihood of a phenomenon called a cytokine storm. This is where the immune system overreacts and produces too many of the chemicals to fight an infection.So you get a severe inflammatory reaction which has the potential to cause significant damage in the body, including organ failure.

                      Thermal scanners are quite effective in detecting people who have developed a fever due to coronavirus. But the thermal scanners are unable to detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. It is more effective to provide prevention recommendation messages to travellers and to collect health declarations at arrival, with travellers' contact details, to allow for a proper risk assessment and a possible contact tracing of incoming travellers.

No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.Hairdryers can reach a temperature of about 95°C when held at a distance of 5 cm. That’s almost the temperature of boiling water. Just because healthcare practitioners use heat to sterilise equipment does not mean that any kind of heat is good for killing microbes or the virus in this case. Besides, exposing your mouth and nose to that kind of temperature may just give you thermal burns and cause dryness in your mouth and nose. Experts say that dry air can cause dehydration and respiratory conditions like allergies, nosebleeds and sinusitis.

                      No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.

"Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations," the WHO said.The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water, according to the organisation.

                      Smashing rumours about the COVID-19 infection spreading through radio waves, UN agency for Information and Communication reportedly asserted that the latest broadband technology 5G was not responsible for the spread of coronavirus and any theory linking the two was a ‘hoax that has no technical basis.’ According to a UN report, dozens of towers were destroyed and scores of engineers were abused after the rumour spread in the UK and other parts of Europe. The reports added that in the recent few months, 5G phone masts have been destroyed in many European countries including Belgium and Cyprus.

                      Alcohol is known to be harmful to health in general, and is well understood to increase the risk of injury and violence, including intimate partner violence, and can cause alcohol poisoning. At times of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, alcohol consumption can exacerbate health vulnerability, risk-taking behaviours, mental health issues and violence. WHO/Europe reminds people that drinking alcohol does not protect them from COVID-19, and encourages governments to enforce measures which limit alcohol consumption.

Unlike other myths related to COVID19, there is no truth to this claim. The most common symptoms of coronavirus are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Quite a few people develop severe symptoms like pneumonia. Holding your breath can only give you an idea if you have a cough or not. Only specific tests carried out by the experts in the laboratory can tell if you are infected or not.

There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus (COVID-19) or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.

                      The idea that various types of heat and light may help protect against the virus may be based on early research that has suggested SARS-CoV2 may be vulnerable to sunlight and higher temperatures. However, most of this research is highly preliminary, not peer reviewed and seems to be contradicted by some of the facts on the ground.

                      THE coronavirus infection cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites while sharing some common myths about the novel coronavirus and its outbreak in the country. According to the Centre for Disease and Research (CDC), mosquitoes can’t spread all types of viruses. For a virus to pass from one person to another through a mosquito bite, the virus should be able to replicate inside the insect. According to Faheem Younus, a Twitter verified Chief Quality Officer and Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland UCH, " This infection is spread via respiratory droplets, not blood. Mosquitos don’t increase spread."

                      The immune system is at the heart of some of the most important questions about the coronavirus.Our immune system is the body's defence against infection and it comes in two parts.The first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. It is known as the innate immune response and includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells.But this system is not specific to coronavirus. It will not learn and it will not give you immunity to the coronavirus.Instead you need the adaptive immune response. This includes cells that produce targeted antibodies that can stick to the virus in order to stop it and T cells that can attack just the cells infected with the virus, called the cellular response.This takes time - studies suggest it takes around 10 days to start making antibodies that can target the coronavirus and the sickest patients develop the strongest immune response.If the adaptive immune response is powerful enough, then it could leave a lasting memory of the infection that will give protection in the future.

                      It’s true that UV light can decrease the viability of viruses (including the new coronavirus) on surfaces, but "that doesn’t mean people with COVID-19 who expose themselves to UV light—or sunlight, which contains UV radiation—will get rid of the infection,” infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Maryland, tells Health. There’s also the fact that UV light comes with some potentially serious health risks. UV rays can penetrate and damage skin cells, and overexposure to UV can lead to skin cancer.
